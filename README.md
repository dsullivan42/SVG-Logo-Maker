# SVG-Logo-Maker
For this code, we give the user a prompt, in the integrated terminal, asking them to enter a 3 letter abbreviation for their company, to choose the color for text, to choose the color of their shape, as well as the shape, for their SVG logo. Afterwords, the properties for the user's desired SVG file is generated, and added into the logo.svg file, in the examples folder, alongside the circle.svg, square.svg, and triangle.svg files.

I don't remember this exactly, as I wrote these credits when the assignment was initially due, however I ended up rewriting a lot of the code in this regardless, and didn't have any issues, with what I've learned in the past couple months. 
Credits:
Talked with a friend, to help walk me through the logic, for times when I was lost, as well as help with code in a couple places where my  code wasn't functional.
Source for await function, I learned about this previously, but had to reread to fully know how it functions.
